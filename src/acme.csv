"Monday, September 1, 2025","It really does all start with a single line of code. This September, we're stripping it all back and going #BackToBasics.
We want to hear from you! What was the very first tech skill you were excited to learn? Was it HTML, Python, or maybe even BASIC?

"Wednesday, September 3, 2025","Ready to start your journey into tech but not sure where to begin? Here's a simple roadmap for your first steps:
1?? Choose Your Interest: Are you drawn to building websites (Web Development), working with data (Data Science), or protecting systems (Cybersecurity)? Find what excites you!
2?? Learn the Fundamentals: Master the basic building blocks. For many, this means learning languages like HTML/CSS, Python, or SQL.
3?? Build a Small Project: Apply what you've learned! Create a simple webpage, a small app, or analyze a dataset. It’s the best way to make your new skills stick.

"Friday, September 5, 2025","Let's bust a major tech myth!
Myth: You have to be a math genius to have a successful career in coding.
Fact: While math is crucial for some specialized fields (like data science or cryptography), most programming is about logic, problem-solving, and creativity. If you can think through a problem step-by-step, you have what it takes!
Don't let the fear of complex math hold you back from starting your tech journey. #ACMETech #MythVsFact #Coding #TechSkills",https://drive.google.com/file/d/19GO935XSlBpn38J2mTOGIk9wBXfa2rGZ/view?usp=drive_link
"Monday, September 8, 2025","Ever wondered about the difference between UI and UX? Let's use a simple analogy: building a house.
UX (User Experience) Design is the blueprint. It’s about the structure and flow. Does the house have a solid foundation? Are the rooms located logically? Can you get from the kitchen to the dining room easily? It's all about how it works and feels.
UI (User Interface) Design is the interior decoration. It’s the paint color, the furniture, the light fixtures. Is it visually appealing? Are the light switches easy to find and use? It's all about how it looks and interacts.
You need both to make a great house (and a great product!). Which part of the process interests you more? #ACMETech #UIUX #UserExperience #UserInterface #DesignThinking",https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XYAYsuL20bN0tbxZkk9mU7A0AKnGaWu/view?usp=drive_link
"Wednesday, September 10, 2025","What separates a good product from a great one? A focus on User Experience (UX). Here are 5 core principles that guide great design:
1?? User-Centered: Design for your audience, not yourself. Solve their problems and meet their needs.
2?? Useful: Does your product solve a real problem and provide value? If it's not useful, it won't be used.
3?? Usable: Can users accomplish their goals easily and without confusion? Good UX is intuitive.
4?? Accessible: Can people with a wide range of abilities use your product? Great design is inclusive.
5?? Desirable: Does the design create a positive, emotional connection? It should not only work well but feel good to use.

"Monday, September 15, 2025","Every website you visit is built on three core technologies. Think of it like building a person:
?? HTML (HyperText Markup Language): This is the skeleton. It provides the basic structure and content of the page.
?? CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): This is the clothing and appearance. It styles the HTML, adding colors, fonts, and layouts to make it look great.
?? JavaScript: This is the brain and muscles. It adds interactivity, making the website functional and dynamic—think clickable buttons, animations, and forms.
These are the essential building blocks of the web. Which one are you focused on learning right now? Let us know! ?? #ACMETech #WebDevelopment #HTML #CSS #JavaScript",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBif5WFPdgmXr105IPA39arqyThk9s_4/view?usp=drive_link
"Wednesday, September 17, 2025","Ever wondered what ""Frontend"" and ""Backend"" really mean? Think of a restaurant.
??? Frontend is the dining room. It's everything the customer sees and interacts with—the decor, the menu, the table setting. In web development, this is the visual part of the website (colors, fonts, buttons) built with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
????? Backend is the kitchen. It's the hidden engine that makes everything work. It takes the orders, cooks the food, and manages the inventory. In web, this is the server, the database, and the application logic that powers the site, using languages like Python, Java, or Node.js.
Which part of the restaurant would you rather work in? The dining room or the kitchen? Let us know your path! ?? #ACMETech #WebDevelopment #Frontend #Backend #Coding",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qkyWl3x3MwXy557BeGu9lMddTTEBjGSv/view?usp=drive_link
